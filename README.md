 Deploy Your Portfolio ->>
 
Once your portfolio is ready, you can deploy it online so recruiters can access it. Here's how:

GitHub Pages: If you want to host it for free, push your code to GitHub and use GitHub Pages to deploy it. It’s quick and easy.

Netlify or Vercel: Both are free hosting services that allow you to deploy static websites quickly.

For example, if you use GitHub, you can link your repository with Netlify or Vercel, and they’ll automatically deploy your website whenever you push changes to your GitHub repo.
